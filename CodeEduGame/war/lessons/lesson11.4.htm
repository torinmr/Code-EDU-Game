<h3>Mission 11.4: Card Counting--Using Conditionals to Fix a Problem</h3>
<div class="objectives">
<h4>Objectives</h4><ol>
<li>Reset your card count when the deck is reshuffled</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If you click submit a lot of times, keep close track of the hands that are played, and are very perceptive, you will notice that after a while your card count readout is no longer representative of the cards remaining in the deck. This is because you are playing with a 52 card deck which must be recombined and reshuffled when it runs out of cards. When the deck is recombined, the card count value must be reset to 0 and card counting must restart.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is an easy problem to fix. We've made a boolean called <span class="variables">reshuffled</span> that we will set to true every time the deck has been reshuffled. Just use an if statement to check if the deck has been reshuffled. If it has been reshuffled, reset <span class="variables">cardCount</span> to 0 and <span class="variables">reshuffled</span> to false so you won't reset <span class="variables">cardCount</span> again on your next turn. It's your job to figure out where this if statement should go.</p>
<p>If you're having problems, make sure the beginning of your code looks like <a href="">this</a>.</p>
