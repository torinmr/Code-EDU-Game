<h3>Lesson 6.2: Total Value With More than Two Cards--Make the Loop Loop</h3>
<p>Every time we run through the loop, we need to add the value of the current spot in the array to the variable $sum and then increment the counter by one to keep track of our place in the array. Inside the braces { } of the while loop, write<br />
<div class="code">sum = sum + handValue[counter];
$counter = $counter + 1;</div><br />
Donâ€™t get scared by all the variables, its simpler than you think. The first line sets $sum to itself (initially zero) plus the value of the card at position counter. This may seem a little strange, but recall that counter is just a variable representing a number. It starts at 0, so this line is initially just like saying <br />
<div class="code">$sum = $sum + $handValue[0];</div><br />
The second line sets $counter to itself plus one, so the second time it runs through the loop the first line will get the value at position 1, the third time will get the value at positon 2, and so on. Remember when we promised you'd see a case where the order of commands was crucial? This is one.      It is important that the adjustment of $counter occurs after that of $sum or else the first spot would be skipped.</p>
<p>Now we just need to replace somethingtrue with a boolean expression telling the computer to run through the loop until it has gone through the whole hand. Since $counter is counting the position in the hand, we can compare this value to $length, the variable that represents the size of the hand. Inside the parentheses following while, write<br />
<div class="code">$counter &lt; $length</div><br />
Some tricky stuff: Why did we use &lt; instead of &lt;=? Remember that $counter, like the positions in an array, starts at 0. However, when sizeof() counts and returns the size of an array, it starts at 1. So, if you have an array with 4 items in it, the last position is 3 and sizeof() will return 4. 3 is the last number that is less than 4, so position 3 is the last position that will be added to $sum. Once $counter is incremented to 4, the statement in the while loop will be false because 4 is equal to, not less than, the size of the array and the loop will then be skipped. The program will continue after the loop. If you used &lt;=, the computer would try to find something at position 4 and you'd have another problem due to JavaScript returning "undefined."</p>
<p>Now all that's left is to return $sum, the total value of all cards. After the closing brace of the while loop, write<br />
<div class="code">return $sum;</div><br />
 Press submit, and observe how the computer makes a different decision when you have more cards!</p>
