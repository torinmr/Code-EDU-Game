<h3>Lesson 9.1: Double Down &mdash; Multiple If Statements in a Row</h3>
<p>With the addition of betting, we can also add a part of the game called doubling down. You can only double down immediately after being dealt to. That is, you cannot hit and then double down. When you double down, you double your bet and then only get one more card. This can be a good thing to do if you have 10 or 11 points in your hand at the beginning because you won't bust and there's a high probability you'll get a card worth 10 points and have a winning hand. We'll just double down when you have 10 points in your hand at first. (For the following lessons, remember that we are still only counting an Ace as 11.)</p>
<p>We've written a function for you called <span class="variables">doubleDown()</span>. You will need to add another if statement checking to see if the value of your hand is 10 and if it is the program will need to double down. Let's think about where to put this if statement. It needs to be inside the first else statement along with the hit/stand if-else statements because it is another option for the computer to consider when planning its move. This also means it is not done at the beginning of the hand. It also needs to be checked before the computer checks to see if it should hit, for two reasons. First, after you hit you are no longer allowed to double down. Second, the range of total value that makes the program hit (range&lt;17) includes the range that makes it double down (range==10). Order is important in this case. The included range must be placed first; if it were placed second it would never be reached because range&lt;17 would be true for a value of 10, causing you to hit when you want to double down. So, make an if statement that checks to see if the total value is 10 and, if so, doubles down and place it within the first else statement but above the if statement checking the total value. Press submit a few times, and when it does double down, you may get an error. We'll correct that on the next page.</p>
