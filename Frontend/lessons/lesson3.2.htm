<h2>Lesson 3.2: Hit or Stand &mdash; Conditionals and Returns</h2>
<p>Excellent! Now we just need to replace somethingtrue with the condition that needs to be met before you hit. First, you need to understand <em>booleans</em>. A boolean is a type of variable that is either true or false. Try replacing somethingtrue with true. (Note that somethingtrue is just gibberish to the computer, but it knows what true means.) Don't delete the parentheses! Press submit. Now your program will always hit because the statement following the if is always true, literally!</p>
