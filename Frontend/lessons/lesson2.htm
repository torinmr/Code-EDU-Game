<h2>Lesson 2: Hit &mdash; Methods</h2>
<p>Hello there, {NAME}! Nice to meet you. Good work on the first lesson. Now it's time to learn how program the computer to play the game!</p>
<p>A <em>function</em>, also known as a <em>method</em>, is a short line of code that makes the computer do stuff. You'll learn how to write a function later, but for now, try one we wrote that hits. (Remember, hitting is asking the dealer for a card.) To do that, on the line below the one where you set your name, type<br />
<div class="code">hit();</div><br />
"hit" is the name of the funtion. Every function name is always followed by an open and closed parentheses (). You'll see why later. And notice that the semicolon is once again present to end the line. Hit submit, and the dealer will deal you a card before dealing cards to itself! You may have busted, but that's ok. You know how to make the computer do things, and, as the tutorial goes on, your program will get better and better at winning. One final thing to notice here: No matter how many blank lines you put between your naming command and your hitting command, the computer will still do the same thing. Try it!</p>
<p>If your code is not working or your name is no longer displaying correctly, make sure your code looks like <a href="#">this</a>.</p><!--This link should open up a picture of the proper code (below) over the game stage. I think a picture will be good because then the user can't just copy and paste. It would also be ideal if this paragraph only showed up after they submitted at least once.-->
