<h2>Lesson 3.3: Hit or Stand &mdash; Conditionals and Returns</h2>
<p>Now it's time to use a <em>boolean expression</em>, or comparison. There are a few comparisons you can make between variables and numbers:<br />
== checks to see if the thing on the left equals the thing on the right and <em>returns</em> true if it is and false if it isn't. "Return" simply means "give the computer a value." (Remember, = is used to asign a value to a variable. It is never used for comparisons.)<br />
&lt; checks to see if the thing on the left is less than the thing on the right and returns true if it is and false if it isn't.<br />
&gt; checks to see if the thing on the left is greater than the thing on the right.<br />
&lt;= checks to see if the thing on the left is less than or equal to the thing on the right.<br />
&gt;= checks to see if the thing on the left is greater than or equal to the thing on the right.<br /></p>
<p>Try replacing true with<br />
<div class="code">3 == 3</div><br />
and press submit. Since 3 does in fact equal 3, the computer will do the same thing! Now, replace one of the 3's with a 4 and press submit. Your player should now stand every time because three does not equal 4, that is, the expression returns false and so the computer skips over the if statement and straight to the else statement. Try experimenting with comparing numbers using &lt;= and other operators.</p>
<p>You can also compare variables. Try replacing the expression inside the parentheses after if with<br />
<div class="code">$name == "yourname"</div><br />
The program will evaluate this as true and hit every turn! Instead of comparing a number to a number, you are comparing a variable to a string. Replace "yourname" with a different string, and it will evaluate as false and the program will stand. Try it!</p>
<p>There's one other cool thing you can do with boolean expressions. What if you wanted to see if something is not equal to something else? An ! means "not" in boolean expressions. So, != checks to see if the thing on the left is NOT equal to the thing on the right and returns true if it is unequal and false if it is equal. Try replacing the == in the statement comparing $name to a string that isn't your name with !=. The computer will now evaluate this statement as true and will once again hit every turn.</p>
